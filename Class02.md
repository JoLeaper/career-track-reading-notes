| Term   | Definition  |
|---|---|
| **functional programming**  | The process of building software using nothing but function (avoids shared state, mutable data, and side-effects).  |
| **pure function**  | Functions that return the same result if the same arguments are passed in. They do not make network requsts or mutate data. |
| **higher-order function**  | A function that either takes in a function as an argument or returns a function. |
| **immutable state** |  State that cannot be changed.  |
| **object**  | A data-type that is meant to represent a real-world item or concept. It has properties and methods unique to it.  |
| **object-oriented programming**  | Rather than making a program around functions and logic, object-oriented programming is a model that designs around the data or objects.  |
| **class**  | 'Special Function' that can be used to define function expressions and declarations |
| **prototype**  | How JavaSCript objects inherit features from one another.  |
| **super**  | Used to access and call function in an object's parent. |
| **inheritance**  | An object's ability to access methods and other properties from another object |
| **constructor**  | A function that initializes an object |
| **instance**  | Installation of a class |
| **context**  | The object within the function being executed |
| **this**  | A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in nonâ€“strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) |
